Kanye West Quoter Tester
A. Scenario
Haha - and then we didn't even write a single test for it

The short comment in the elevator hits you in the stomach like fist of ice... Tests - we haven't written any tests for the code I wrote yesterday. This is just not finished...

Luckily there is still time - not due until tomorrow

B. What you will be working on
Today we are going to write tests for our Kanye West Quote application. For all levels in the testing pyramid

Unit tests
which probably will need some refactoring to make code testable
use mock (Moq - https://www.nupwdget.org/packages/Moq/)
try to make a pure function somewhere in your code
Integration tests
Using AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing (https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing/)
End2End test
Using plain old HttpClient
I suggest that you create one xUnit test project per type of test.

C. Setup
Continue to work in the solution that you created yesterday.

D. Lab instructions
First create a few unit tests
How can I verify the code here as a unit is a good starting point
Use Moq and xUnit
Ensure that you take every edge-case;
what if it throws an error
what if I get another return value
what if I get null
what if I get exactly what I was looking for
Then create a few integration tests
Verify that the unit integrates together
Use AspNetCore.MVC.Test and the example code from the slides
Finally create one or two e2e tests
Use the HTTPClient
Remember that you will need to start dotnet run the API in order to access it through your tests
